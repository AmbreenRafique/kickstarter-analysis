# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

The original data contains 4115 counts of rows, which provide following information:
- Name of the show
- Blurb
- Goal
- Pledged
- Outcomes by country and currency
- Deadline
- Launch Date
- Backer’s count
- Category/Sub-category

Deadline and the Launch dates are to be converted otherwise the data is readable.

### Purpose
The purpose to analyse the data to help the client (named Louis) with her project campaign in theater category. By analysing this crowdfunding projects, we can understand historical trends to help Louis in making a decision for her upcoming project.

## Analysis and Challenges
To analyse the trend in past we have to have deep dive in the data and analyse according to following variables:
-	the pledged amount against the goal amount, 
-	success ratio by launch date/time in the year,
-	outcomes according to category/sub-category.


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
According to the data provided the projects of ‘theater category’ have highest chance of success in the month of May.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
By analysing the past trend there is approximately 54% chance of success in achieving her goal of raising $12000 in crowdfunding. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Thousands of rows, data spread in the range of $1 to $10,000,0000 with various categories and changing trends over time.


## Results
Analysing the data closely by considering the ‘goal’ of Louis and category she is interested in, we conclude that there are equal chances of success or failure. Her chances are better if she launches the campaign in the month of May as it shows the highest success rate in theater category. We propose that the campaign should approximately run for 30 days to achieve its desired outcome.
The success ratio was 100% in 2013 in theater category if we analyse the data near to her goal amount (i considered $8000 to $20,000). It would be helpful for her if she considers the subcategories of theater shows launched in 2013.


- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Month of May is the best to consider to Launch the campaign. Summertime period is good to launch with minor fluctuations in success ratios.


- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
The goal amount up to $5000 has a much better success ratio. Considering $12,000 as goal amount has more than 50% chance of success.


- What are some limitations of this dataset? 
Analysing the data near to her Goal amount and her criteria would be more useful and can show better results.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
The country and place are not mentioned where Loise intends to launch her campaign. Otherwise, we can analyse it according to that specific country/currency to get better understanding.
